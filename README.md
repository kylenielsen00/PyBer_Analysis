# PyBer_Analysis

Purpose

  The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary data frame of ride-sharing data by city type, and also to create a line graph to visualize the total monthly fares for each city type.

Results

  It's shown that the amount of rides get larger as the size of the city gets larger. Number of rides was also connected to the number of drivers as it also shows a  relationship between city sizes and total drivers & total rides. Also, the total fares showed a similar relationship. But, if we look at the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, it shows the opposite relationship as rural city types had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
From the multiple-line chart, the total fare of urban cities had the highest fare followed by suburban and rural cities.

Summary

  The area of rural cities had the highest average fare per ride, since this took only around 5% of total rides.
  The average fare per driver and per ride was the lowest in urban areas and this took almost 70% of total rides.
  Suburban drivers were only about 17% of total drivers, but they had much higher total fares which took almost 30% of total fares.
